# RAG-based-PDF-Question-Answering-Bot
This project is a **PDF-based QA Bot** built using **LangChain**, **IBM Watsonx LLM &amp; Embeddings**, and **Chroma** for vector storage. The bot uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDF documents.  Users can upload PDFs and ask queries, and the bot will return answers.
